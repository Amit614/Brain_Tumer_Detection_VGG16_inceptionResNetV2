# Brain_Tumer_Detection_VGG16_inceptionResNetV2
study deals with automated brain tumor detection and classification. Normally the anatomy of the brain is analyzed by MRI scans or CT scans. The aim of the project is tumor identification in brain MR images. The main reason for detection of
brain tumors is to provide aid to clinical diagnosis. The aim is to provide an algorithm that guarantees the presence of a tumor and Finally, we detect whether the given MR brain image has tumor
or not using tarnsfer learning with VGG16 and InceptionResNetV2.
